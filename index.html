            <p>Hello! My name is Cathreen Paul, and I am currently a second-year student at Northeastern University, pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science and Business Administration. I am concentrating in Healthcare Management and Consulting within the John Martinson Honors Program. With a passion for leveraging data-driven insights, my academic journey is focused on understanding the intricate relationship between technology, business, and healthcare.

                Throughout my studies, I have gained a strong foundation in data analytics, business strategy, and healthcare operations, and I am committed to using these skills to drive impactful change in the healthcare sector. My goal is to bridge the gap between technology and healthcare, transforming the way care is delivered and improving overall outcomes for individuals and communities. By combining my knowledge in data science with a deep understanding of business strategies, I aspire to develop evidence-based solutions that address complex healthcare challenges, such as improving access, optimizing resources, and enhancing patient experiences.
                
                In addition to my academic pursuits, I am excited to explore real-world applications of my learning through internships, collaborative projects, and research initiatives. I am driven by the belief that data and technology can be powerful tools in revolutionizing healthcare for the better.
